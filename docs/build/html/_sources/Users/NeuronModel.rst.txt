Neuron Models
=============

The simulator covers most widely used neuron models from a simplest Integrate and Fire Model to a rather complex Hodgkin-Huxley(in progress) models. All the models are parametrisable with easy interface to change the parameters. Also, a network can have a combination of these models. For examples, for a layered feedforward network, input layer can be comprised of one model and the next layer be another and so on. 

.. note:: No two models can be in the layer for a layered network
