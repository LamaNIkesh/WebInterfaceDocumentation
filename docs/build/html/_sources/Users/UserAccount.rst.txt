User Account
============

All the users must create an account before proceeding with the simulation for a simple reason that all the configurations and results are to be stored in a corresponding user folder.

Once the account has been successfully created, users can access all the previous simulations or current simulations. The users can also start, stop or abort simulations at any time.
