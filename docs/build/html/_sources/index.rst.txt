FPGA Web Interface: Introduction
===================================

The Field Programmable Gate-Arrays(FPGAs) clusters offers a powerful hardware platform capable of performing realistic simulations of Biological Neural Systems(BNS). However, making use of such powerful platform is not easy and not all users have enough understanding and experience to exploit such hardware. Having a user friendly software platform to interact with FPGAs in a much higher abstraction level will allow more researchers to make use of such powerful hardware without having to spend a lot of time actually understanding the platform. Such user interface takes away a certain level of abstraction and makes it intuitive and easy to generate desired biologically inspired neural network with desired neuron models, synpase models, network size, network topology and desired stimulation configuration for the neural network. Here, we discuss web based user interface that we developed to interface with the FPGA cluster that allows users to easily and intuitively create desired network to be run on the FPGA cluster. 

.. note:: So far only biologically inspired spiking neuron models are implemented.

The document is divided into two parts-for users and for developers. The user documentation talks about how to use the platform and the possibilities offered by the platform. The developer part gives details about the overall structure of the platform for further development.
