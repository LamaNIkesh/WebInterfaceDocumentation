Introduction:
=============
This is a web interface that allows users to design their custom spiking neural networks with different neuron models which in turn will be run on the high performance FPGA clusters. The web interface is linked to the interface manager (IM) which works as an intermediate node between web interface and the FPGA clusters. IM receives the simulation initialisation files from the web interface and sends result packets once the simulation has completed back to the web interface.
