Platform Overview
=================

The web interface is linked to the interface manager (IM) which works as an intermediate node between web interface and the FPGA clusters and manages flow of packets to and from both FPGAs and web interface.IM receives the simulation initialisation files from the web interface generated by the users which will be sent to the appropriate FPGA nodes for simulation and result packets received from the FPGA clusters once the simulation has completed are sent back to the web interface. It can be shown as :

Some of the features of the web interface are listed below:

* Select existing parameterisable neuron models from the model library(Current Models: Integrate and Fire, Leaky Integrate and Fire, Izhekevich). 
* Specify number of neurons with same or different neuron models.
* Select layered or non-layered network. Layered network would be a feedforward network where the first layer is the input layer and last layer is the output.
* Select same or different neruon models on each layer. All the neurons in a single layer will have the same neuron model. 
* Select the type of topology; fully interconnected, random or probabilistic(30% connection at the moment)
* Configure the simulation paramters such as simualtion time, timestep size, watchdog period etc. 
* Specify stimulation parameters such as start and end time and voltage. [*Only step stimulation is implemented at the moment*]
* Visualisation of the spike train obtained after the simulation as raster plot.
