User Manual 
===================
This part of the documentation is focused to provide a comprehensive details of the interface to users. This section covers currently implemented neuron models, different options of topologies, stimulation options followed with some examples and tutorials on how to create a network, change parameters, assign stimulation parameters and run the simulations. The simulations can be stopped, aborted or restarted at any point. Once, the network is mapped into the FPGA cluster, users can run the simulation at their own convenience. 

.. note:: A fixed timeout will be assigned later to allow for fair usage of the cluster
